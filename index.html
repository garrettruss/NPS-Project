            <p id="brief">
            In the spring of 1872, President Grant signed The Act of Dedication which perversed the northwestern corner of Wyoming around the Yellowstone river from settlement or sale and dedicated the land as a public park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people. Yellowstone became the world first natitonal park. <br/> In the years following, this concept of preservation grew. In 1916, the National Park Service Organic Act was signed by President Wilson and manded the agency "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Since then, the National Park Service has grown to preserve over 85 million acres across 423 units of over 20 different types such as the 63 National Parks like Yellowstone, National Seashores like Cape Cod, and National Monuments such as the Statue of Liberty. Although these properties are preserved, the are accessible for public use and enjoyment. <br/> Come explore and see what opportunities the National Park Service has to offer. Explore the listings by searching for a keyword such as Acadia or Yellowstone, or search by a state abbreviation such as CA or NC.
